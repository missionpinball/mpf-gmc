# MPF-GMC: Godot Media Controller for the Mission Pinball Framework

![Godot BCP Logo](https://github.com/missionpinball/godot-bcp-server/blob/main/icon.png?raw=true)

The Godot MC is a plugin for connecting Godot to the Mission Pinball Framework (MPF) using the Backbox Control Protocol (BCP).

With this plugin, pinball creators using MPF can choose Godot as their display engine and drive all screen slides, videos, animations, and sounds via a Godot project.

## Features
* Direct socket connection between MPF and Godot for high-speed synchronization
* Fully extensible base classes allow customization and overrides
* Direct access to player variables, machine variables, and settings
* Built-in signals for core events, extensible to add any signals you need
* Easily subscribe to MPF events and send events to MPF
* Support for keyboard input bindings to aid in development

## Installation

Create a new Godot project and find Godot MC in the Asset Library. Add this plugin to your project and save.

_Note: Godot BCP Server uses custom class names for extending support to your project. It is recommended to exit and restart Godot after adding the plugin, to ensure that the class names are recognized and available._
